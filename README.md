## Description: 
We will be analyzing the occurrence of mental illness across the world, and how that occurrence varies by gender and socioeconomic status. Using that data, we will incorporate how ease of access to healthcare and the amount of government expenditure on mental health programs and resources affects suicide and crime rates in relation to mental illness incidence. 

## Questions:
* What is the occurrence of mental illness across the world?
    * Make note of how data is reported (self-identification, medical records, etc), and use that to predict how much is undiagnosed

* How is mental illness broken down by gender and socioeconomic status?

* How do access to healthcare and government expenditure on mental illness affect suicide and crime rates?

## Breakdown of Tasks:
* Define mental health/illness
* Gather data showing occurrence of mental illness across the world
* Gather data showing occurrence of mental illness by gender per country
* Gather data showing occurrence of mental illness by socioeconomic status per country
* Gather data showing ease/lack of access and availability to healthcare
    * Number of doctors, hospitals, health programs, etc, per country
* Gather data showing amount of money spent by each countryâ€™s government on mental illness treatment/help
* Gather data showing suicide rate per country, also by gender and socioeconomic status
* Gather data showing crime rate per country, also by gender and socioeconomic status
